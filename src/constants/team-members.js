My interests expand over a wide range of topics: from crypto currency, DeFi, liquidity mining and crop rotation to traditional finance and asset management. For the past 5 years, I studied and closely followed the development of blockchain technologies and parallel use-cases, writing an academic paper in 2018 titled: “From Bitcoin to Augur: the first decentralized prediction market platform.” Additionally, I am very passionate about the arts in every shape and form.',

I firmly believe that DeFi and DAO’s are a means to revolutionize how we think about work and the future of management. My main interest in DeFi is truly democratizing the governance process through trust signaling, and deterministically recognizing meaningful contributions. Too often systems only recognize those already in power and not the ones who seek to create positive change, I will change that!

I've worked with and researched into dozens of different cryptocurrencies in the past decade, written a good amount of Solidity, and my belief in Kadena and Pact is paramount. Outside of crypto, I am a programmer almost from birth, spending most of my time tinkering with code, electronics, and robots, but I also derive great joy from photography, videography, and digital art.
