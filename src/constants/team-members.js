    "I am Daniele, aka Mandrake. Nice to meet you all. I am the CFO of Kaddex, and have been involved in this amazing project since the very beginning. I have two Master's degrees: one in business administration, and one in finance. My interests expand over a wide range of topics: from crypto currency, DeFi, liquidity mining and crop rotation to traditional finance and asset management. For the past 5 years, I studied and closely followed the development of blockchain technologies and parallel use-cases, writing an academic paper in 2018 titled:“From Bitcoin to Augur: the first decentralized prediction market platform.” Additionally, I am very passionate about the arts in every shape and form, and sports. Should you want to know more about me, feel free to drop me a message and I would be more than happy to chat with you!",
