I spent the initial years of my career working for one of the major companies in Italy, helping corporations expanding their activities and carrying on new investments. My main interests have always been expanding over a wide range of topics: from crypto currencies to DeFi, from liquidity mining and crop rotation to traditional finance and asset management. My DeFi adventure starts in 2018, I wrote an academic paper titled: “From Bitcoin to Augur: the first decentralized prediction market platform.” Lastly, I am very passionate about arts in every shape and form.',

I have worked on a few other DeFi projects and DAOs such as Fei Protocol on the community side of things and have been semi involved in crypto since 2018. I firmly believe that DeFi and DAO’s are a means to revolutionize how we think about work and the future of management. My main interest in DeFi is truly democratizing the governance process through trust signaling, and deterministically recognizing meaningful contributions. Too often systems only recognize those already in power and not the ones who seek to create positive change, I will change that!

I've worked with and researched into dozens of different cryptocurrencies in the past decade, written a good amount of Solidity, and my belief in Kadena and Pact is paramount.
