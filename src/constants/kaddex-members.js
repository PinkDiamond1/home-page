I firmly believe that DeFi and DAO’s are a means to revolutionize how we think about work and the future of management. My main interest in DeFi is truly democratizing the governance process through trust signaling, and deterministically recognizing meaningful contributions. Too often systems only recognize those already in power and not the ones who seek to create positive change, I will change that!

I've worked with and researched into dozens of different cryptocurrencies in the past decade, written a good amount of Solidity, and my belief in Kadena and Pact is paramount. Outside of crypto, I am a programmer almost from birth, spending most of my time tinkering with code, electronics, and robots, but I also derive great joy from photography, videography, and digital art.
